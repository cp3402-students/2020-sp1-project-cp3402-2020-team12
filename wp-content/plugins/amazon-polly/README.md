## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Do I need to have an AWS account to use the plugin?

Yes. You can create one here: https://aws.amazon.com/free/

#### Q: What is Amazon Polly?

Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to turn text into lifelike speech that sounds like a human voice.

#### Q: How much does Amazon Polly cost?

For current pricing information, see the [Amazon Polly pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/).

#### Q: Does Amazon Polly participate in the AWS Free Tier?

Yes. As part of the [AWS Free Usage Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), you can get started with Amazon Polly for free. Upon sign-up, new Amazon Polly customers can synthesize up to 5 million characters for free each month for the first 12 months.

#### Q: Which languages can I use with Amazon Polly?

For the full list of languages that Amazon Polly supports, see [Languages Supported by Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/SupportedLanguage.html).

#### Q: Does the plugin delete my Amazon Polly audio files if I delete the plugin?

No. All audio files are preserved. Depending on your configuration, they will be stored on your WordPress server, or in your Amazon S3 bucket.

#### Q: Does the plugin support SSML tags with Amazon Polly?

Amazon Polly supports multiple SSML tags. For more information, see the [Amazon Polly documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html).

The AWS for WordPress plugin currently supports only the <break> SSML tag. For more information, see [Supported SSML Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html).

To use SSML tags, you need to enable Amazon S3 as the storage location for your files, and enable SSML support on the plugin configuration page. Then, in the wizard for creating a new WordPress post, you can add SSML tags. Here is an example of content with the SSML break tag:

Mary had a little lamb <ssml><break time="3s"/></ssml> whose fleece was white as snow.

#### Q: Is there additional cost for storing Amazon Polly audio files on S3?

Yes. For current pricing information, see the [Amazon S3 pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

#### Q: How do I view my Amazon Pollycast feed?

Append '/amazon-pollycast/' to any page URL. For example:

* example.com/feed/amazon-pollycast/
* example.com/category/news/feed/amazon-pollycast/
* example.com/author/john/feed/amazon-pollycast/

#### Q: How do I publish my Pollycast podcast with iTunes?

Submit your Amazon Pollycast to the iTunes iConnect directory at https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/.

#### Q: How is the Amazon Polly bulk update cost calculated?

If you bulk update fewer than 100 posts, the plugin calculates the number of characters in all of the posts and then, based on Amazon Polly pricing, provides an estimate for the cost of conversion. If you bulk update more than 100 posts, the plugin calculates the average number of characters in the first 100 posts and then, based on this, estimates the total number of characters in all posts to provide a cost estimate.

#### Q: What kind of filters can I use with Amazon Polly?

The plugin has the following filters:
- `amazon_polly_post_types` â€“ Specifies which WordPress post types should be used by the plugin. The default value is `post`.
- `amazon_polly_content` - Enables you to modify the content of the post before it is sent to the Amazon Polly service for text-to-speech conversion.
- `amazon_polly_s3_bucket_name` - Enables you to define your own bucket name where audio files will be stored. The bucket must already exist and be in the same region as you specify in the plugin configuration. You must also modify the IAM policy to provide access to this bucket.

#### Q: What are lexicons?

Pronunciation lexicons enable you to customize the pronunciation of words. In the plugin configuration, you can provide the names of the lexicons that you have previously uploaded to your AWS account in the region specified in the plugin configuration. You can provide up to five lexicons, separated by spaces.

#### Q: What is Amazon Translate?

Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service that delivers fast, high-quality, and affordable language translation.

#### Q: Can I use Amazon Translate if I want to store files on the WordPress server?

No. You must use Amazon S3 as the storage location for your audio files in order to enable Amazon Translate functionality.

#### Q: What is Amazon CloudFront?

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
